# Taz Solace

Taz Solace (they/them) is a colourful, queer creative and community organizer who sometimes crafts under the shop moniker the Lunar Garden. A multidisciplinary artist, singer-songwriter, poet, D.I.Y. crafter, upcycler (especially textiles), web/graphic designer, and gardener, Taz explores many passions through their queer and neurodivergent lens. They dream of rad, kinder futures, thriving nourishing communities, plants, colours, magic, rainbows and cats.

Taz is an immunocompromised, neurodivergent disabled person of Quebecois and Doukhobor descent. They live on the unceded lands of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (Squamish), and Sel̓íl̓witulh (Tsleil-Waututh) Nations.

Follow them throughout the internet at @TazSolace (https://linktr.ee/tazsolace) and you can reach out to them about collaborations including upcycled art, content creation, music, sharing resources with local queer & trans artists, and hiring them for design work.

One of their current projects includes curating a monthly micro gallery at Cross & Crows Books, a queer-run bookshop at 2836 Commercial Drive in East Van, featuring mask-mandatory art, poetry and storytelling events.
